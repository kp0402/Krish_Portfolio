# Deep Learning Researcher - Ultrasound Video Analysis Project![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3024a9d7-b50e-4597-9230-d968ccd40968)

•	Pioneered the creation of a novel ultrasound dataset of 10000 images, the first of its kind, aimed at assessing colonic motor patterns and content flow.
•	Designed and implemented various deep learning models, including U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Attention Res U-Net, for accurate segmentation of colonic walls in ultrasound images, achieving a test set IoU of 90%.
•	Developed and optimized real-time video processing pipelines for colon motility analysis, incorporating techniques like optical flow, contour detection, and polygon approximation.
•	Applied  Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and wavelet analysis to analyze rhythmic motor patterns and detect signal frequencies associated with colonic motor activity.
•	Clinical Relevance: Demonstrated the use of ultrasound as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for assessing colonic motor dysfunction, with potential applications in treating chronic constipation and motility disorders.
•	Presented a poster on this project at the MLHC 2024 conference, where it was accepted, offering valuable insights into the role of AI in healthcare.
