# Deep Learning Researcher - Ultrasound Video Analysis Project 

Ever wondered what AI and gut feelings have in common? Well, I built a deep learning pipeline that analyzes colonic motor patternsâ€”because even intestines need good segmentation!

ðŸ”¬ What I Did:
âœ… Dataset Creation: Curated a novel ultrasound dataset of 10,000 images (yes, thatâ€™s a lot of gut footage!) to assess colonic motility and content flow.
âœ… Deep Learning Magic: Trained U-Net, Attention U-Net, and Attention Res U-Net models to segment colonic walls, achieving a test set IoU of 90%â€”because accuracy matters, even in bowel movements.
âœ… Real-Time Processing: Developed video processing pipelines using optical flow, contour detection, and polygon approximation, optimizing analysis speed (because no one likes waiting for gut insights).
âœ… Signal Analysis Wizardry: Applied Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and wavelet analysis to detect rhythmic motor patternsâ€”think of it as AI listening to the gutâ€™s symphony. ðŸŽµ
âœ… Clinical Impact: Showcased the potential of ultrasound as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for assessing colonic motor dysfunction, offering hope for treating chronic constipation and motility disorders (AI: making lives smoother one algorithm at a time!).
âœ… Conference Recognition: Presented a poster at MLHC 2024, where it was acceptedâ€”because AI in healthcare deserves the spotlight!

ðŸš€ Why This Matters
This project blends deep learning, medical imaging, and real-time video processing to push the boundaries of non-invasive diagnostics. From gut instincts to gut intelligenceâ€”AI is revolutionizing how we analyze and treat digestive disorders!
